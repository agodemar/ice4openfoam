Ice accretion modelling in OpenFOAM

Development of custom functions within the framework of the OpenFOAM solver/modelling library. The user-defined solvers will model the physics of super-cooled water droplet in a fluid dynamic field with a Lagrangian approach. The focus is on capturing some known phoenomena of ice accretion observed on the external shape of airplanes, especially on their wings.
